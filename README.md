# EyeTrack2Scene
EyeTrack2Scene is a Python-based tool designed to map eye-tracking data to movie viewing data of subjects. By integrating advanced video segmentation using a panoptic model, this project enables precise analysis of where viewers focus during film playback. This repository also incorporates a collaborative panoptic model developed by Friend's Name or GitHub Handle, which significantly enhances video segmentation accuracy .Currently, the tool supports eye-tracking data in the ASCII format exported from EyeLink 1000 systems (https://www.sr-research.com/software/).

The eye-tracking data provides spatial coordinates from fixation events (denoted as EFIX), indicating where the participant is focusing. These gaze points are mapped onto segmentation masks generated by the panoptic model for the corresponding time frame. This mapping enables the identification and segmentation of the specific region or object in the movie frame that the participant is likely focusing on.
