# EyeTrack2Scene
EyeTrack2Scene is a Python-based tool designed to map eye-tracking data to movie viewing data of subjects. By integrating advanced video segmentation using a panoptic model, this project enables precise analysis of where viewers focus during film playback. This repository also incorporates a collaborative panoptic model developed by Friend's Name or GitHub Handle, which significantly enhances video segmentation accuracy.


## Features
- **Eye-Tracking Integration:** Maps raw eye-tracking data to specific regions in movie frames.
- **Panoptic Video Segmentation:** Leverages state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation to identify meaningful regions in video scenes.
- **Collaborative Contribution:** Incorporates the panoptic model developed by [Friend's Name or GitHub Handle](insert-link-here).
- **Customizable Pipeline:** Modular design allows for adjustments to segmentation and eye-tracking data formats.
